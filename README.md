# GeoMap
GeoMap is a Rails-based application that allows users to create and visualize locations on an interactive map. Each location is marked with a custom marker on the map. 
Users can view all created markers on the index page and also see the specific location of a selected place, alongside their current location.

This project utilizes MapLibre for map rendering, Stimulus for front-end interactions, and ActiveStorage for handling file uploads associated with places.

# Features
Create Locations: Allows you to create locations that will be displayed on the map.
View All Locations: On the index page, all created locations are displayed with their respective markers.
